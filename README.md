# HeapSort
main.c reads integers from stdin and adds each one to a Heap.
Then it will prints the Heap tree structure as XML.
Lastly it prints the integers in both sorted and reverse-sorted order.

intStack.c is the stack data structure with the functions push, pop and isEmpty.

intHeap.c contains the heapAdd, heapDelete and heapSize functions
